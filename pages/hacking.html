      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>          
            In 2013, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee Edward Snowden copied and leaked over 50,000 classified documents from the National Security Agency (NSA). These documents revealed how the NSA collected and stored data from United States citizens and foreign entities. The 2016 film “Snowden,” a biographical thriller film about the event, paints Snowden as a national hero. In the final scene, the audience applauds the real Edward Snowden, smiling on stage (“Snowden”). And yet, just last year, Associated Press News published that the United States is still recovering from the Snowden effect, which “put U.S. personnel [and] facilities at risk around the world, damaged intelligence collection efforts, [and] destabilized U.S. partnerships abroad” (Riechmann). This language—risk, damage, destabilize—sheds a contrasting, negative light on the situation. U.S. citizens can’t seem to make up their minds. Is Edward Snowden a patriot, or a traitor? Although his actions were illegal, were they somehow justified? Herein lies the ethical dilemma of hacking. Although rarely done to Snowden’s scale, hacking affects our digital society every day. Its ethicality, and more importantly, our national response to it, will come to define the future of the digital world.
          </p>
          <p>Although many believe hacking to be unequivocally wrong, there is strong evidence that it plays a crucial role in our digital society. Through my research, I’ve come to recognize that hacking is not to blame for the digital failures of the world. Through discussing the background of hacking and examining two ethical dilemmas, I hope to demonstrate how hacking is a complex field that cannot be reduced to black and white, how federal regulations are not fluid enough to accommodate an ever-changing technological world, and how, in its purest form, hacking represents the transformative nature of technology. In the proper context, I believe encouraging hacking will secure a brighter technological future.
          </p>
          <h2>History and Background</h2>
          <p>
            What is hacking? Certainly, the word typically has a negative connotation, associated with activities like “breaking passwords. . .denial of service attacks. . .releasing viruses. . .adulterating Web sites” (Leeson 514). However, while hacking includes those, it is better defined as any unconventional or unauthorized interaction with a computerized system through vulnerabilities. Unconventional, meaning outside of the original design. Vulnerabilities, meaning back doors, or alternative paths. One could go as far as to say hacking occurs any time someone exercises their own creativity with the limits of technology. However, no definition of hacking in my research explained what motivates hacking, and in that omission, we see a crucial nuance.
          </p>
          <p>Today, motivation divides hackers into three categories: black-hat, white-hat, and gray-hat hackers. Black-hat hackers are “the bad guys,” as characterized by Zoran Cekerevac in his article “Hacking, Protection and the Consequences of Hacking,” and according to a 2002 study, they make up approximately 11% of the hacker population (Cekerevac; Schell). This is not a large percentage, but neither is it insignificant. One cannot deny that there are hackers with malicious intent, seeking to exploit computer vulnerabilities for personal gain—these are the individuals that most people think of when they first hear the term hacking. But one then must ask—who are the other 89% of the population? If only 11% intend to cause harm, what do the other 89% hope to accomplish? 
          </p>
          <p>This question can be partially answered by the second group: white-hat hackers. These are the exact opposite of this traditional hacker. They choose to hack only within current legal constraints. These hackers hope to identify “vulnerabilities that can be patched once found,” improving computer security (Ott 125). By placing the solution, “patched,” so close to the problem, “vulnerabilities,” social ethicist Kate Ott reveals that white-hat hackers are motivated by fixing, not breaking. While they also circumnavigate the designer’s intended uses, they do so when asked for the purpose of improving computer security. In this case, hacking represents a good thing, a vital part of digital development. Unfortunately, Schell’s survey revealed that this group makes up only 5% of the hacking community—those whose professed motivation was to “make society a better place to live” (Schell). This tells us that while not all hackers have malicious intent, not very many use hacking to bless others.
          </p>
          <p>This brings us to the third, largest group—grey-hat hackers. Grey-hat hackers are those in-betweeners, those who engage in ethically-ambiguous behavior to accomplish purposes that are neither malicious nor benign. Consider the phrases “hacking the system” or “life hack.” These common phrases are often used to express how someone, by their own ingenuity or cleverness, finds an easier, more efficient, or more helpful way to do something. The third on the list of “100 Incredible Life Hacks That Make Life So Much Easier” is “Use a rubberband to keep a door from latching” (Lee). 
          </p>
          <p>The door latch was probably designed to lock upon closing, a feature that some may find inconvenient. Thus, any alteration to that mechanism is outside of the original design, or unauthorized. Using the capability of a rubber band to keep it open is interesting and uncommon. Some might even say unconventional. The fact that the lock can be altered represents a weak point in the system, an opportunity for change. A vulnerability. This is an example of grey-hat hacking. It is not inherently malicious, nor benign. But it is still ethically ambiguous. For example, there may be a rule against modifying door latches or consequences for keeping a door perpetually unlocked. And regardless, some people will choose to alter the door latch’s intended design and hack it to stay unlocked.
          </p>
          <p>Grey-hat hackers’ motivations include, among others, “[advancing] network, software, and computer capabilities” and “[solving] puzzles or challenges,” as well as “hacktivism,” hoping to make a political statement, or “counterhacking,” hacking only those who have already hacked them (Schell; Handbook 196, 206). Note that Snowden likely fell into this category. He felt violated by the NSA’s data collection and used hacking to make a political statement about it. Economist and professor Peter Leeson comments that “in gaining unauthorized access to computer systems [grey-hat hackers] pose potential security threats, but they do not themselves cause damage” (Leeson 516). Snowden’s action—releasing classified documents to the public—did not cause direct damage, as committing credit card fraud or compromising someone’s password does. However, Snowden clearly posed a security threat because his actions led to intense collateral damage in the United States. Thus it becomes apparent that grey-hat hacking isn’t inherently destructive, but it is not necessarily benign either. 
          </p>
          <p>This group needs to be our focus. It is the equivalent of a swing state in a tight electoral race. It is these individuals—their choices, their ethics, and their actions—who will determine the future role of hacking in our society. As a result, the following ethical dilemmas regarding moral rights and national regulation will focus primarily around the grey-hat hackers: how they understand an ethical issue, and how those outside of the hacking community view the same issue. In exploring the relationship between the two, it is my belief that we will discover important policy-making strategies for managing hacking in the future.
        </p>
        <h2>The Rights Dilemma</h2>
        <p>
        The first ethical dilemma can be called the rights dilemma. It is a conflict between the rights of property, privacy, and expression that citizens elevate to a moral level. Those opposed to all hacking practices claim that it infringes upon their rights to personal property. The Handbook of Information and Computer Ethics, most recently edited by Kenneth Himma in 2008, explores the rights dilemma within a hacking context. It states that without proper authorization, acts of hacking “constitute a digital trespass onto the property of another person” (Handbook 191). That property, in a hacking situation, would be the physical computer subject to the hacking attempt. This argument holds up when a hacker breaks into a computer and physically takes control of it, as in hijacking a car or plane’s automated systems. However, Himma points out that digital property is not as easily defined as physical property (Handbook 191). If hacking merely involves gaining access to information, it could be the same as looking through a window, which isn’t considered trespassing. Since hacking includes such a variety of activities—e.g. disabling settings, writing a script to automate a tedious task, and scraping information from the Internet, none of which constitute a “digital trespass”—it cannot simply be a question of property rights. Thus, claiming that hacking violates property rights, on its own, doesn’t have the breadth or specificity to properly condemn hacking.
        </p>
        <p>Well, if not property rights, hacking opponents will argue that they have a right to privacy and accessing someone’s computer without their permission is a blatant violation of that right. However, even the right to privacy cannot be used to bar all intrusions. Like a schoolteacher obliged to divulge confidential information if a student’s safety is at risk, there are times when an individual’s right to privacy is set aside for the greater good. A company may hire a white-hat hacker to penetrate their system, exposing the data of their employees for the sake of future security improvements. And, likewise, a grey-hat hacker may take it upon themselves to hack, justifying that improving security is worth invading someone’s privacy. Under the rights of privacy and property, Himma states that “the burden rests on the hacker to show that a particular intrusion is morally permissible” (Handbook 193). However, without a standardized guideline to follow, determining what is “morally permissible” becomes entirely situational. Thus, one cannot claim that hacking violates privacy or property rights and is therefore always immoral, because privacy and property rights can be—and are—violated under certain circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>  Finally, hackers will say that regulations which criminalize hacking behavior infringe upon their right to expression, an extension of the First Amendment’s protected freedom of speech. Himma says “this argument is grounded in the idea that. . .there should be no restrictions on the free flow of content.” Hackers who, like Edward Snowden, feel no regret for hacking often believe that hacking is “expressive of their. . .belief that all information ought to be publicly available and free” (Leeson 522). Anything less than that, they may argue, infringes upon their moral rights.
        </p>
        <p> In order to address these competing moral rights, Himma introduces the “Necessity Principle” which states that “the infringement of a right cannot be justified by an appeal to the desirable consequences of doing so” (Handbook 194). If there is another way to guarantee the safety of a student, the teacher should respect the right to privacy. If there is another way to exercise freedom of expression without infringing upon someone else’s property or privacy rights, a hacker should do so. While the Necessity Principle offers one guideline for navigating the complicated terrain of moral rights, it is far from a perfect answer. Deciding what people should do in a certain context is inherently situational and does not translate well into national policy. Rather, by understanding the Necessity Principle, we can understand that hacking is considerably more complex than ill-intentioned virus-planting monsters. There is a tradeoff of benefits and detriments that occurs in every hacking situation, an incentive, so to speak, to hack. Understanding those incentives is the first step to designing effective, ethical national policy.
        </p>
        <h2>The Regulation Dilemma</h2>
        <p>
            Analyzing the hacking incentive, or why people hack, introduces a second ethical dilemma: that of regulating hacking at the national level. Some may wonder if it is even the government’s responsibility to monitor or regulate hacking. The role of the government is a discussion far too big to fully explore in this paper, so for the sake of this analysis we’ll use the ideas originally expressed in the Preamble to the Constitution: “establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity” (“Preamble”). In order for the government to fulfill this charge, they must protect against internal and external threats. In 2011 alone, hackers earned $12.5 billion dollars, with over $170 million of that from companies such as Sony, Citigroup and AT&T (Cekerevac). I think it’s safe to say that hackers pose a significant internal and external threat, which would put it under the federal government’s jurisdiction.
          </p>
          <p>In fact, the government already has several policies in place to address hacking. Leeson writes:
          </p>
          <blockquote>The primary federal law in the United States designed to deal with computer hackers is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. . .this act prohibits under penalty of law: accessing a protected computer without authorization (or exceeding authorized access); accessing a protected computer without authorization. . .transmitting a program, information, code, or command, and as a result of that conduct, intentionally causing damage to a computer system without authorization (computer viruses); (Leeson 525)
          </blockquote>
          <p>The key phrase seems to be “without authorization.” This categorizes all acts which are not expressly authorized by the system’s creator or administrator, as criminal behavior. This kind of umbrella law, while certainly encapsulating criminal computer attacks, dubs any behavior outside of the system as criminal. Leeson comments, “in a nutshell, the present law punishes computer hackers, be they good or bad, with stiff fines and jail sentences” (Leeson 526). Think about that for a moment. A law that fails to recognize harmful behavior and instead punishes “good or bad” alike does not encourage enforcement of or adherence to the laws. In fact, it becomes ineffective.
          </p>
          <p> The problem with current regulation law is best described through economic analysis. Analyzing supply and demand shows that this type of strict umbrella law has actually provided a higher incentive to hack, or as Leeson states, “the stiffer the penalty for hacking imposed by law, the greater the increase in fame-driven hacking” (Leeson 528). This is due to the law of supply and demand, which details how the price of a product—a good or service—determines its supply and demand in a free-market economy. When the price is high, suppliers are eager to supply a good or service because they assume they’ll make good money off of selling it. However, since no one likes to buy at high prices, the demand for that same good and service will drop as the price increases. 
          </p>
          <p> With this law in mind, consider hacking as the product. Stiff regulations of hacking means there’s a lot of risk involved. Traditionally, high risk means high cost—or a high price—and should mean low demand. But interestingly enough. this isn’t the case. Many hackers can be categorized as “fame-driven hackers,” and while profit-driven hackers see the law as a deterrent, fame-driven hackers see it as a challenge (Leeson 511). A challenge that, if overcome successfully, has rich payout at the end. For these fame-driven hackers, the high level of regulation translates into a high reward, increasing the incentive to hack. For fame-driven hackers, current hacking law has the opposite of its intended effect. 
          </p>
          <h2>Future Implications and Potential Solutions</h2>
          <p>
            So what do we do? The presence of hacking is costing American citizens billions of dollars. Enforcing hacking regulations—costly in its own right—is only partially effective at inhibiting hacking. Is it ethical, then, to continue to waste citizens’ money? Is it ethical to stop spending it—assuming the government is responsible for citizen protection—even if the attempt is futile? There is not a straightforward answer. However, I believe changing the approach to hacking regulation law is the first step. We must recognize the nuances in the hacking community, as well as the incentives of malicious hackers, and tailor hacking regulations to specific groups. By penalizing fame-driven and profit-driven hackers in distinct ways, the government will better address the underlying cause for malicious hacking and lift the chokehold that currently restrains benign hackers.
          </p>
          <p>In a digital society, the solution cannot be to ignore or shun digital creativity. Exploring and testing the limits of technology as it currently is, to find what it can be, is imperative for our nation’s technological future. It is not only unfortunate, but crippling, that this sort of digital creativity has been lumped in with credit card fraud and cyberattacks. In order to ensure that our technology industry has room to grow and thrive, we cannot regulate hacking as we have historically, with a one-size-fits-all criminal brand. Instead, Kate Ott proposes in her book Christian Ethics for a Digital Society, that “the changes to social practices, relationships, and identities brought about by digital technology. . .require that we deploy moral approaches that are as responsive and flexible as the networking model upon which the technology is built” (Ott 129). Responsive and flexible regulations are regulations that understand the differences between black-hat, white-hat, and grey-hat hacking. These regulations will focus in on black-hat hackers with distinct punishments for fame-driven and profit-driven hackers. They will define acceptable limits to the rights of property, privacy and expression. They will validate the importance and benefits of benign hacking, while discouraging malicious hacking. By creating regulations with these qualities in mind, we will begin to embrace the responsive and flexible style needed to respond to a digital world.
          </p>
          <p>But creating these regulations will never be a simple process. Ethics are most easily evaluated and implemented on an individual basis, so creating a standard for a group whose members may have differing ethical philosophies is extraordinarily difficult. As a result, when ethical issues arise in a group setting—such as hacking in the context of national regulation—it is helpful to create an environment of “discourse ethics” in order to make the best decision (“Toward” 118). Described by Mike Markel in his book “Ethics of Technical Communication,” discourse ethics is a process of decision-making in which all affected parties are involved and heard before a decision is made. Technology industry leaders, grey-hat hackers, victims of hacking, and those whose passwords are 1-1-1-1 and can’t fathom how their child hacked their phone—each perspective is crucial in determining the most ethical course of action. Markel states that “a rational discussion carried out according to the principles of discourse ethics inevitably uncovers the core values of the discussants” (“Toward” 126). These core values will be those our nation—as a collective body—prizes most highly, and it is those core values which should show up in national regulation of hacking activity. In that way, we can eliminate the situational nature of rights-based ethics and feel confident in regulating hacking at the national level.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, at the individual level, each of us has become a digital citizen. A digital citizen who is part of a collective society, a digital society, where technology is key. If we are to be responsible citizens in every context, we must participate in our communities in a way that builds and uplifts. That participation may be brand new. It may be unconventional. It may involve “hacking,” in one way or another. It’s true, Edward Snowden hacked. But while he spread awareness about government use of data, he greatly damaged the capacity of the government to fulfill its role in providing for the common defense of the people. We must elevate ourselves from hacking to destroy and instead hack to create. Hacking to create, to discover, and to learn—in this context, hacking becomes a “transformative act” (Ott 132). And it is each of these transformative acts that will shape our digital future.
